#### An application where users may view top 100 songs, 16/01/19
#### By **Jeremy Kimotho**
## Description
This is an application where users may view the top 100 songs for the week worldwide or in a specific country. If they're interested in the song, a user may then click to view the youtube video for that song if it's available.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* This is a great place
* to list setup instructions
* in a simple
* easy-to-understand
* format
{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
## Known Bugs
Currently though I have figured out a way to provide youtube links, the quota is making it impossible for me to the service for more than about 10 minutes before I'm locked out of the database. Searching for a solution or alternative then will publish website.
